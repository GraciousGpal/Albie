# Albion Online Discord Assistant Bot

![](Images/example.png)

Thanks to the [Albion Online Data Project](https://www.albion-online-data.com/), and the many players that download and
run the Data Project [client](https://github.com/BroderickHyman/albiondata-client/releases) while playing the game,
market price data are collected and shared freely with all Albion players. Perhaps the most popular tool that utilized
these data is [AlbionOnline2D](https://www.albiononline2d.com/en/item).

The Discord bot fetches the latest minimum sell order prices (same as AlbionOnline2D), and plots the past 7 days
historical prices, for the item that you asked. The bot will find the closest match to your query and also provides item
suggestions in case you forgot how to spell.
